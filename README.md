# fxhash_template
Fxhash template with fixed canvas size and resize handling with CSS.

Download the following files and start coding on your local server:
License.txt
index.html
p5.min.js
sketch.js
style.css


Variable 'w' in sketch.js is the size of your canvas. You can change it to create canvas of the dimensions you like. The resizing is handling by CSS so you don't have to worry about window resizing. Your sketch will always fit perfectly in the window and the sketch's content will not change at resizing.
